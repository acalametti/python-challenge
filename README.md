# python-challenge

Contributer: Alex Calametti 
Overview: The goal of this project was to analyze two different CSV files using Pything in Visual Studio Code. This project is broken down into two separate challenges: PyBank and PyPoll. The PyBank portion of the project analyzes financial data. This folder includes CSV data (budget_data.csv), an analysis folder containing a summary of the results as a .txt file, and the main.py file. The PyPoll portion analyzed election results. This folder also includes the CSV data (election_data.csv), a folder containing a summary of the results as a .txt file, and the main.py file. 
How it was done: To begin, in separate files and Python scripts, the two CSV files were read into the Python program. Once the CSV files were read in, variables were assigned. For PyBank, a for loop was created to calculate the total amount of months, the total change in profits/losses, the average change in profit/losses, the greatest increase in profits, and the largest decrease in profits. For PyPoll, the total number of votes cast in the election was calculated. This data was also used to find the number and percentage of votes for each candidate using if statements. The winner of the election was then found based on who received the highest number of votes.
Special thanks to tutor Geronimo Perez for helping me get started on this project and BCS Learning Assistant Saad for helping me tweak the PyPoll portion of my code.
